# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

# Wrong number of arguments given to the initialize method from the SongBird class
# If you call super with no arguments it will pass up all arguments from the child method
# Therefore we need to pass up what is necessary like so:

class SongBird < Bird
  def initialize(diet, superpower, song)
    super(diet, superpower)
    @song = song
  end
  # rest of code omitted for brevity
