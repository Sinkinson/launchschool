# In the last question we had a module called Speed which contained a go_fast method. We included this module in the Car class as shown below.

module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  include Speed
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end

# When we called the go_fast method from an instance of the Car class (as shown below) you might have noticed that the string printed when we go fast 
# includes the name of the type of vehicle we are using. How is this done?

# >> small_car = Car.new
# >> small_car.go_fast
# I am a Car and going super fast!

# This is possible because self references the calling object when used inside an instance method. So when we see self.class, it is the same as calling
# class on the Car object. We don't need to use to_s here because the string is interpolated, which means to_s is called automatically
