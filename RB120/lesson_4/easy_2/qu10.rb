# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

# - Allows the programmer to have containers for data
# - Can manipulate data without affecting the rest of the program
# - Can reduce the amount of complexity
# - Can reduce the amount of methods required through the use of inheritance
# - Gives greater structure to a program
# - Requires less passing round of instance variables as they are contained within the object
#   so are therefore available within instance methods without having to be passed in
# - Creating objects allows the programmer to think more abstractly
# - Objects are represented by nouns so are therefore easier to conceptualize
# - It allows the programmer to expose functionality to the parts that require it -- namespacing
#   issues are therefore harder to come across
# - We can build applications faster as we can use pre-written code
# - As the software becomes more complex, this complexity can be more easily managed
