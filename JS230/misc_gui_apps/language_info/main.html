        <h2>Ruby</h2>
        <p class="hide" id="ruby">Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented,
          general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s
          by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan. According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl,
          Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
          including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type
          system and automatic memory management.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="hide" id="javascript">JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted
          programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language
          specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core
          technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ
          it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins. JavaScript
          is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language,
          supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.</p>

        <h2>Lisp</h2>
        <p class="hide" id="lisp">Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming languages
          with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.
          Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming
          language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year. Lisp has changed
          since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best
          known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme.</p>
